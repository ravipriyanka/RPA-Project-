This is the source code for the rpart package, which is a recommended package in R. It gets posted to the comprehensive R archive (CRAN) as needed after undergoing a thorough testing.

Overview
The rpart code builds classification or regression models of a very general structure using a two stage procedure; the resulting models can be represented as binary trees. The package implements many of the ideas found in the CART (Classification and Regression Trees) book and programs of Breiman, Friedman, Olshen and Stone. Because CART is the trademarked name of a particular software implementation of these ideas and tree was used for the Splus routines of Clark and Pregibon, a different acronym - Recursive PARTitioning or rpart - was chosen.
